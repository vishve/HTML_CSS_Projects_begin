# HTML_CSS_Projects_begin
contains a list of projects that started off as HTML-CSS-Javascript beginer projects. 
The source code is created with the help of https://youtu.be/EWv2jnhZErc
This helped me gain first - timer confidence in the HTML- CSS- Javascript world, the very baby steps that every one has to walk . 
I have learned the DOM, the CSS BOX models and Events (all basic types starting form inline to function declaration 
then taking the code to JS and linking the file back to the HTML
and finally listener: addeventlistener followed by event deligation ) 
Now , lets do some projects to get all 3 in a sort of running form. 

The future projects will be lengthy and we start including the python Django and scrapy soon in the month of Aug itself, all paved up. 
I am missing the MERN to be continued.
